## Open issues

<!-- Remove these as they are done, add additional as necessary -->

- [ ] Upgrade baseline Jenkins version to current Infra minimum
- [ ] Refactor to multi-module build if additional plugins are required
- [ ] Implement continuous delivery style non-snapshot version tagging with https://github.com/stephenc/git-timestamp-maven-plugin (may require finding a Maven repository to push to)
- [ ] Allow configuration of the gitpubsub end-point from the main Jenkins config screen
- [ ] Figure out where to track issues in JIRA and update this file with issue tracking process
